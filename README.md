## Installation

This application is on pre-alpha stage. So currently only available with [npm](https://npmjs.com).

```
$ npm install --global tuitter
```

## Usage

Start from command line.

```
$ tuitter
```

To show DevTools, set the environment variable. There will be two DevTools window.
One is for renderer process of native window. Another is for `<webview>` which actually renders https://mobile.twitter.com.

```
$ NODE_ENV=development tuitter
```

## Config

Configuration is written in JSON file. Please edit it with your favorite editor.
If you want to reset configuration, please simply remove the JSON file and restart application.

```sh
$ $EDITOR {data dir}/config.json
```

The `{data dir}` is depending on the OS.

- `~/Library/Application\ Support/Tui` for macOS
- `~/.config/Tui` for Linux
- `%APPDATA%\Tui` for Windows.

To know type of values of each keys, please see [type definition](./typings/config.d.ts).

### hot\_key

`hot_key` is a key sequence to toggle application window. The shortcut key is defined globally.
The format is a [Electron's accelerator](https://github.com/electron/electron/blob/master/docs/api/accelerator.md). Please see the document to know how to configure this value.
Default value is `"CmdOrCtrl+Shift+S"`. If you want to disable, please set empty string or `null`. 

### icon\_color

Color of icon in menu bar. `"white"` or `"black"` is available. Default value is `"black"`.

### always\_on\_top

When this value is set to `true`, the window won't be hidden if it loses a focus. Default value is `false`.

### normal\_window

When this value is set to `true`, application will be launched as a normal window application.
If menu bar behavior does not work for you, please use set this value to `true` to avoid it.
Default value is `false`.

### zoom\_factor

Font zoom factor in application. It should be positive number. For example, `0.7` means `70%` font zooming.
Default font size is a bit bigger because https://mobile.twitter.com is originally for mobile devices. So default value is `0.9`.
